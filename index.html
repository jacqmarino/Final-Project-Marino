<p> My name is Jacqueline Marino and I am a student at the University of Miami majoring in Broadcast Journalism with minors in Public Relations and Advertising. When I began college, my dream was to become a sports newscaster. However, as I explored my capabilities I realized that I thoroughly enjoy other departments of the school of Communication as well.
​
I am experienced in Adobe Creative Cloud Programs such as Illustrator, Indesign, Photoshop and Premiere. I am proficient in using cameras such as the Sony PXW-Z150 and the Canon 5d. I have also held the role of technical director for UMTV where I operated a Grass Valley Karrera Series video switcher and video inputed over 20 sources in a program.
